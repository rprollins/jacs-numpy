# JACS: Working with NumPy

JACS is a series of introductory computing sessions aimed at new postgraduate students at the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. For more information visit [jbca-jacs.bitbucket.io](https://jbca-jacs.bitbucket.io/).

Many scientific workloads involve performing repeated numerical
operations on homogeneous arrays of data. NumPy is a python
library that can offer orders of magnitude improved runtime over
the core python library for such operations while retaining a
high level of abstraction for ease of use. This session will cover
the core features of NumPy and demonstrate how to make effective
use of them through a series of worked examples.
